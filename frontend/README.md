# Sharelink Assignment

The purpose of this assignment is to create a fullstack application utilizing react, redux and postgres.

## Technologies implemented

- [ ] react
- [ ] react-redux
- [ ] jwt
- [ ] redux-thunk
- [ ] redux-logger
- [ ] redux-thunk
- [ ] redux-logger

### Potential Problems:

- Parameters (when creating actions, reducers, knowing what gets passed in and what comes out)
- Checking for conditions (useSelector)
- Confusing knex queries
- Planning with backend - thunk axios - whenever we post, dispatch anything, what would we expect back? Being clear about that - having a graphic organizer for that.

### Thunks:

##### Thunk Name

GetBugsThunk

##### Component

BugList

##### Input and Output

input: search, userId

##### Actions dispatched

axios.get(bugsUrl + /userId) -> then if get response, dispatch GetBugsSuccess(response.data)
